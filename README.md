# A C++ (xeus-cling) computing environment for binder

[![Binder](https://beta.mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://beta.mybinder.org/v2/gh/nthiery/xeus-cling-binder-env/master?filepath=index.ipynb)

Have a repository full of Jupyter notebooks using the C++ 
[xeus-cling](https://github.com/QuantStack/xeus-cling) interpreter?

This repository illustrates the use of Binder to open such notebooks
in an executable environment, making your code immediately reproducible by anyone, anywhere. 

It can also be used in combination with [Thebe](https://github.com/minrk/thebelab)
to turn C++ code snippets in static html pages into live cells.
